            <h3>Our Engineering Survices</h3> <br>
            <p>Surveying is a basic element of all civil engineering projects. Surveying is “the science of making 
                precise measurements between known and unknown points, applying the principals of mathematics 
                to determine positional locations at a required accuracy, and the art of publishing mapping products 
                which meet the needs of the customer”. Surveying determines the relative spatial locations of points 
                or objects (features) on or near the surface of the earth, for the purpose of graphically portraying 
                the terrain data or geometrically locating their 3D coordinates. In transportation engineering; 
                surveying provides the foundation and continuity for route location, land appropriation, design and 
                construction of capital projects. Surveys also establish a basic "framework" of horizontal and vertical 
                control which is valuable in the stakeout of engineered designs during the construction of a project, 
                as well as in the reestablishment of highway right of way.</p>
